Talk: Build yourself a Haskell web framework
============================================

Zurich HaskellerZ meetup -- 27 October 2016

Slides were created using [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) and can be viewed online at https://cbaatz.github.io/build-a-haskell-web-framework/.

To run the code from the live-coding session:

1. Install [Stack](www.haskellstack.org/).
2. Got to the `demo/` folder in this repo.
3. `stack ghci` then type `:main` at the prompt. This starts the web-server. Press Ctrl-C to stop it.

Please note that the code form the live-coding session is not polished, merely a proof-of-concept.
